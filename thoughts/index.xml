      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times to articulate a purpose for Life without much success. I usually begin well enough and then find myself lost in the weeds as I realize that I haven&amp;rsquo;t grounded the concepts of Life or Purpose well enough on a foundation of core philisophical terms and principles.
Reading philosophy and listening to philosophy podcasts, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t found anybody from the distant or recent past that quite hit on the points I was trying to make, and also found that being a great philosophical mind did not always correlate with being a wonderful writer.</description>
