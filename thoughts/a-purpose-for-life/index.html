			<h2>A Purpose for Life</h2>
			<time>January 25, 2018</time>
			
			<div>
				

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried many times to articulate a purpose for Life without much success.  I usually begin well enough and then find myself lost in the weeds as I realize that I haven&rsquo;t grounded the concepts of Life or Purpose well enough on a foundation of core philisophical terms and principles.</p>

<p>Reading philosophy and listening to philosophy podcasts, I hadn&rsquo;t found anybody from the distant or recent past that quite hit on the points I was trying to make, and also found that being a great philosophical mind did not always correlate with being a wonderful writer.  This was both frustrating and encouraging.  I felt I had unique ideas to put forth, but couldn&rsquo;t quite find the right philisophical framework to build on and did not enjoy the prospect of starting from scratch, as many philosophers have enjoyed doing.</p>

<p>But then I found myself with a copy of Dr. Sean Carroll&rsquo;s copy of <a href="http://amzn.to/2Bsmws2" target="_blank"><em>The Big Picture</em></a>.  I quickly got the sense that I had found what I was looking for.  As I poured through all the groundwork of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">poetic naturalism</a> I was again bother delighted and discouraged, but for opposite reasons.  I was delighted at having finally found a foundation for my ideas, but was sure Dr. Carroll had either reached my same conclusions or had preemptively evicerated them.</p>

<p>Yet, when I had finished the book and looked up some of his related work , I realized that Carroll had not reached the same concolusions regarding the purpose of life and had not really put up any obstacles.  In fact, his train of thought had cleared many obstacles out of my way, delivered me to within spitting distance of my destination, and provided me a bag set of shiny new tools with which to clear the rest of the way!  So he goes nothing.</p>

<h3 id="life-as-a-whole">Life as a Whole</h3>

<p>First, let me say that when I describe a purpose for life.  I am not referring to an individual life, but to the endeavor of Life as a whole.  While my personal ethic and moral framework are based on the points I&rsquo;ll be laying out, their details will have to be an essay for another day.  What I&rsquo;m concerned with here is &ldquo;What is the purpose of the process of life as a whole?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I do not believe that life is unique to Earth, and perhaps the life of Earth may not even be unique to Earth (another discussion for another day).  Without observing life outside our planet, we can only speculate.  However, I believe that the conclusion I reach would apply to anything we could call Life in any part of the Universe, so I will posit it as a universal truth at my own peril.</p>

<h3 id="poetic-naturalism">Poetic Naturalism</h3>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s quickly outline the tenets of poetic naturalism as defined in <em>The Big Picture</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Naturalism comes down to three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only one world, the natural world.</li>
<li>The world evolves according to unbroken paterns, the laws of nature.</li>
<li>The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially, naturalism is the idea that that the world revealed to us by scientific investigation is the one true world.  The poetic aspect comes to the for when we start talkig about he world.  It can also be summarized in three points:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are many ways of talking about the world.</li>
<li>All good ways of talking must be consistent with one another and with the world.</li>
<li>Our purposes in the moment determine the best way of talking.
(p. 20)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about individual interactions between atoms you will use a different narrative and language than when you&rsquo;re discussing large collections of atoms.  Quantum and molecular interactions are definitely taking place within gases, however, for the purposes of analyzing the properties of a gases the best way of talking isn&rsquo;t to invoke wave functions, but to discuss the gas laws.</p>

<p>This is relatively straightforward and much of the book discusses how the emergence of different levels of observable phenomenon can be used to develop true and useful stories of how the world works within this framework.</p>

<h3 id="dr-russell-s-simple-narrative">Dr. Russell&rsquo;s Simple Narrative</h3>

<p>So, returning to the Purpose of Life, it seems to me that many true stories could exist, so long as they follow these tenets.  The only direct reference to a &ldquo;purpose of life&rdquo; that Carroll refers to in his book appears at the beginning of chapter 32, &ldquo;The Origin and Purpose of Life&rdquo;, where he recalls a chance encounter with Dr. Michael Russell, a geochemist at NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p>

<p>While both were enroute from northern California to a conference in Montana they happened to be seated next to each other on the same plane.  When Russell happened to notice that Carroll was studying statistical physics in relation to the origins of life, he commented on his familiarity with the work.  When Carroll asked his opinion on life&rsquo;s purpose as it related to the work:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy&rdquo;, he replied with a nod.  &ldquo;The purpose of life is to hydrogenate carbon dioxide.&rdquo;  (p. 261)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I proceeded from this point, I kept expecting Carroll to refer to this simply as a true story at the level of the chemical process of life and then put forth another story of purpose that would be useful at a higher level.  This story never manifested, even as it turned toward evolution and emergence (including an entire chapter on &ldquo;Emergent Purpose&rdquo;), and then on to consciousness and morality.</p>

<h3 id="my-simple-narrative">My Simple Narrative</h3>

<p>So now I get the opportunity to present a narrative that is as simple and true as Dr. Russell&rsquo;s, but, I believe, more meaningful at the human level.  As much I enjoy doing my part to hydrogenate the carbon dioxide of Earth, it certainly doesn&rsquo;t get me out of bed in the morning.</p>

<p>Earlier in the book Carroll discusses the evolution of complexity and entropy within a closed systems (ch. 28, p. 225).  This section is also covered in <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/11/03/entropy-and-complexity-cause-and-effect-life-and-time/" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/" target="_blank">Carroll&rsquo;s website</a> in a beautiful series of videos by Henry Reich and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics" target="_blank">MinutePhysics</a> team.</p>

<p>Over time, the entropy of a closed system always increases, while the complexity of the system will increase and then decrease in a parabola.</p>

<p>Life is the ultimate complex system, since organisms can use free energy (increase entropy) to maintain out-of-equilibrium states<a href="#note-1">1</a> and within the domain of life, the most complex system would be the human brain itself, making the human brain the ultimate in complexity density in the known universe.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of Life, we see billions of years where the complexity of life has increased by way of evolution, and through the millions of years of human history we see how humanity has leveraged their ability to create technology to increase the complexity of civilizations.  Given these observations, I say:</p>

<p><strong>The purpose of Life is to maximize the area under the complexity curve within the enclosing system.</strong></p>

<p>While Russell&rsquo;s narrative applies to the known Life we observe on this planet, where the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide is the main mechanism by which the system increases entropy, I believe that my narrative would apply to any process we could find in the Universe that we would call Life.</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So What?</h3>

<p>So what does that mean for us?  Are we supposed to just make everything on Earth as complex as possible?  Isn&rsquo;t complexity a bad thing?</p>

<p>A lot.  No.  It depends.</p>

<p>For now, keep it simple.</p>
