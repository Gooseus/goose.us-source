			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>

				<p>I am Shawn Marincas, Gooseus is my online alias and pen name (pronounced &ldquo;goosey-yus&rdquo;).  It&rsquo;s a Latinized version of my HS nickname (which was not a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun" target="_blank">Top Gun</a>) which I adapted for myself in college after watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)" target="_blank">Gladiator</a> and needing an Xbox Live handle.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m originally from Brick, New Jersey and am now a resident of Portland, Oregon.  My only formal education is a Bachelors of Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and I&rsquo;m employed full-time as a web developer (or fullstack engineer, or whatever the trending title is).  I consider myself an autodidact and hope that someday I&rsquo;ll be able to consider myself a polymath.</p>

<p>While internet technology is the focus of my job, I&rsquo;m far more interested in the wider subjects of philosophy, science, psychology, economics, and any others involved in understanding the myriad ways the Universe interacts with itself.</p>

<p>I have recently declared myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism" target="_blank">poetic naturalist</a>, following the philosophical framework formalized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll" target="_blank">Dr. Sean Carroll</a> to describe someone who is a naturalist, but also believes that there are many ways of talking about the world, so long as they are grounded in scientific truth and are useful for talking about a particular domain.</p>

<p>I am an agnostic at heart, but enjoy useful stories involving metaphorical god constructs.  I believe that Knowledge is a fundamental unit of Life and self-knowledge would be the goal of a pantheistic God, this follows from my favorite quote from my favorite person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.”<br />
~ Carl Sagan, 1990</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m here to expand and formalize my philosophy of life, the universe and knowledge through further open discussion of my current <a href="/thoughts">thoughts</a>.  To start I have waded into the philosophical waters with the aid of Carroll&rsquo;s poetic naturalism framework with a statement of what I believe is Life&rsquo;s ultimate <a href="/thoughts/a-purpose-for-life">purpose</a>.</p>

<p>As I hope to make clear over time, this philosophy of purpose will give rise to a loose ethical framework and, hopefully, a belief-based network of like-minded individuals and groups who also seek to shape the future of our world with reason and compassion.</p>
