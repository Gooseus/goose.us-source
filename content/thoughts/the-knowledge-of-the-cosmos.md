I'm a glutton for punishment with this post.  After already making outlandish claims regarding [the purpose of life](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life), I'm about to dive into another philosphical hotpot by making claims about "knowledge" well above my pay grade and formal education.  But considering the claims that are made nowadays, by people of great prominence and power no less, I hardly feel like my own can would make much difference if they were ridiculous... and if they aren't, well then, that would be great.

So let's begin with my favorite quote from my favorite person:

> “We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.”  
> ~ Carl Sagan, 1990

So what does the cosmos know of itself?  Knowledge is one of those tricky words with lots of definitions, so lets make sure we're on the same page here.

### Defining Knowledge

[The definition given by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=definition+knowledge) is:

1. facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
  * what is known in a particular field or in total; facts and information.
  * true, justified belief; certain understanding, as opposed to opinion. 
2.  awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.


The first line in [the Wikipedia article for Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) is:

> Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.

And the Oxford Dictionary definition is:

1. Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
  1. The sum of what is known.
  2. Information held on a computer system.
  3. True, justified belief; certain understanding, as opposed to opinion.
2. Awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.
3. *archaic* Sexual intercourse.

That last archaic definition doesn't pertain much, but I found it amusing.

So what definition would pertain to a Universe that didn't include Life capable of awareness.  I don't want to get into panpsychism or talk about some notion of consciousness that pertains to the Universe because it seems like an unnecessary digression.  What I do want to try to get to is a definition of knowledge that involves capabilities and it's entirely possible that knowledge isn't the appropriate word, however, it's what I'm going to go with until I have a better one.

So take, for instance, the idea that the Universe "knows" how to create a star.  This wasn't "learned" in the classical sense, but if you take the notion that the laws of physics became fixed at a point close to the Big Bang, then it could be said that the Universe acquired the information at this moment which with which it was able to then create galaxies, stars, quasars and black holes.

Maybe a better concept would be to describe the knowledge of the Universe to be any phenomenon that can be known by an observer.  The Universe doesn't know how to reverse the arrow of time or decrease entropy in a closed system, but it does know how to increase entropy and construct various material structures at many scales from chemical processes.

If it can be called knowledge regarding the Universe, then it can said to be knowledge possesed by the Universe.  That is some circular logic, but self-evidently true considering our definitions of knowledge can only apply within a Universe that is made up of parts of the Universe, such as ourselves.

### Self-Replicating Knowledge 

So from this point of view, everything that occurs in the Universe that can be known is knowledge that Universe is acting on.  The Universe can produce stars because the laws of nature give it the knowledge to do so.  The Universe can produce complex chemical reactions and self-replicating molecules for the same reason.  A molecule has knowledge of how to react to with other molecules and can produce and produce other molecules.

Some knowledge is fleeting and exists only long enough to produce a reaction and disipates.  However, a self-replicating molecule has the knowledge of how to replicate itself and can persist.  It persists because it has knowledge of how to persist itself, knowledge of how to persist knowledge.  The Universe has knowledge of how to persist knowledge of itself over time, the first evidence of a proto-meta-cognition.

I'm going deep down a rabbit hole now, but we can't stop now, the only way out is through.  The beautiful thing about the classical version of knowledge is that bullshit doesn't last long without having some value to people and since I direct these ideas toward people who only value truth, this entire post can be considered and relegated to the dustbin in a short amount of time if it proves unable to find purchase in the mind of an audience with enough value to then replicate itself in some form of sharing.

Time is the great filter for useless or untrue knowledge... and applying this idea to my conception of knowledge, we find that it applies in the form of evolution.
