### Complexity from Problem Solving

Looking at the history of Life, we see billions of years where life has increased its biological complexity through evolution, and over millions of years of human history we see how humanity has increased technological complexity through conscious innovation.

Evolution and innovation serve the same purposes; at the level of the organism/species and individual/organization, they introduce new mechanisms to solve problems related to the survival and reproduction of genetics, fortunes, products, institutions, culture, knowledge, etc.  

Carroll describes the process of natural selection as a search algorithm (ch. 34, p. 279), with evolution solving the problem of "What organism would survive and reproduce most effectively in this particular environment?".  The genome of each organism is a potential solution to this problem, the solutions that prove effective combine their genome with another effective solution in sexual reproduction, and a new generation of potential solutions is created.  Ineffective solutions are selected out by death or failure to reproduce.

Human innovation in free societies conduct a similar search algorithm where individuals and groups identify a problem and propose solutions.  Selection mechanisms are used to prune the solutions (prototype testing, rigorous debate, capitalist markets, etc.) and the best solution is then adopted by the society at large.  Each solution is designed to confer an advantage on those that adopt it, usually saving time or energy, as well as on the innovators, as financial or political power.

However, these solutions incur a cost, as [Joseph Tainter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter) addresses in his paper [Complexity, Problem Solving, and Sustainable Societies](https://www.goldonomic.com/tainter.htm), where he writes:

> Systems of problem solving develop greater complexity and higher costs over long periods. ... For the past 12,000 years human societies have seemed almost inexorably to grow more complex. For the most part this has been successful: complexity confers advantages, and one of the reasons for our success as a species has been our ability to 'Increase rapidly the complexity of our behavior (Tainter 1992, 1995b). Yet complexity can also be detrimental to sustainability.

Tainter argues that complexity arises by way of inceasing the number of parts and by the increased specialization of those parts.

In orgnanisms and ecosystems this can be observed by looking at the large number of niche organisms that are perfectly adapted to a specific environment by possessing adaptations that are highly specialized for that environment.

Orchids are an example in natural organisms as each species is specifically adapted to attract a specific pollinator.  In human civilization with the specializations of jobs that only do specific tasks in a large organization.  This is also observable with the by looking at the specialization of products and scientific disciplines.

### Problems from Complexity

The costs of complexity is what makes it impossible to sustain high levels for long periods of time on the complexity graph.  Energy is required to solve each subsequent problem and to the maintain the solutions to the previously solved problems.  This means that increased complexity produces diminishing returns on the energy spent.

In addition, high complexity also introduces a harder to identify problem, fragility.

[Nassim Nicolas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) defines fragility in his book [Antifragile](http://amzn.to/2FCmT63)<a href="">[[3]](#note-3)</> as:

> I suddenly realized one day that fragility&mdash;which had been lacking a technical definition&mdash;could be expressed as *what does not like volatility*, and that *what does not like volatility* does not like randomness, uncertainty, disorders, errors, stressors, etc.

> (p. 11-12)

As parts become more specialized they depend more on other parts in order to operate as a whole.  This creation of interdependence means that errors or disruptions in a single area creates a cascading effects.  In orchids, a disruption in the behavior of their specialized pollinator is devastating.

If we could graph the complexity of Earth from its formation, it would not look like the clean parabola from early.  Instead, it would follow along quite nicely with a graph of speciations and extinctions in slow rises and relatively sharp falls.

Life has driven the upward curves of complexity through evolutionary problem solving and massive environmental changes have driven the steep downward slopes through cosmological, geological and ecological mechanisms in the forms of [meteor impacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor), [volcanic eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps), [run-away biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event), and many others.

When a massive change occurs in the environment, it changes what solutions are considered the most effective and it is typically those organisms and institutions which are most specialized to the old environment and those which are most complex that are the first to fail.  The survivors are the simplest organisms and the generalists, which prove to be the most robust.  After a new environment stabilizes, they immediately begin to evolve and specialize within this new environment, repeating the cycle.

A graph specific to the complexity of human civilizations would look very similar to life as a whole.  Humans mimic the same cycles of increased complexity and fragility followed by a reduction once the energy needed to maintain complexity becomes too great and a disruption (or set of disruptions) precipitates a rapid reduction in complexity.

We are playing the same game that Life has for billions of years, so in order to continue the upward trend of complexity and avoid the downward trends (thus maximizing the area under the curve) we must come to understand this nature of complexity and learn from the mistakes and successes of our ancestors, both distant and recent.

### Our Finite System

So in order to increase the area under the curve, complexity must be added to the system in a way that minimizes fragility.  And since increases to complexity create diminishing returns on energy use, the available energy must always be increasing to meet the increasing demand.

However, the available energy in a given system is finite.  If a system becomes too complex without applying that available energy to solving the problem of increasing the available energy, it is doomed to collapse.  On earth this happens in closed ecosystems in a process called [overshoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(population)).

The complex systems that humans create are no different, and much of the existing complexity is based on the easily accessible energy resources provided by fossil fuels.  Humans have applied a lot of energy to solving the problem of making energy available through alternative sources, but the complexity have not been introduced in a way that has minimized fragility.

Environmental damage from exploration, drilling, transportation and refining have created disasters that affect already fragile ecosystems that contain massive amounts of living complexity.  The negative effects of utilizing these fossil fuel sources have accelerated environmental changes and created more extreme weather patterns that test the fragile infrastructure upon which our complexity rests.

### Expanding the System

In order for the Life of Earth to truly maximize the area under the curve, it must create a more robust and clean system of supplying energy and allow complex ecosystems to recover.  However, solving these problems will only stave off the run-away overshoot problem that humans are creating.  Life is still fragile to the geological and cosmological mechanisms that have caused steep reductions in complexity in the past.

What humans must do to fulfill their role in the project of Life is to use apply their innovative problem-solving skills to expand the system that contains Life.  The only way to do that is to make Life an extra-planetary and then multi-planetary phenomenon.  Solving this problem will require a massive amount of added complexity and available energy, so the only way to make it happen is to re-evaluate our priorities and reallocate how we are spending resources now.
