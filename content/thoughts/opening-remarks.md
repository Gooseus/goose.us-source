I've attempted on many occasions to publish thoughts publicly, but have always made false starts feeling that they were not well-formed enough for a wider audience.  I also noticed that they were constantly changing and evolving faster than I could finish them.  Thoughts one day would need be revised by the next and never reached a state I could consider finished.

Also, many of my thoughts involve subject matter that draws lots of people who are way outside their depth and consider themselves far smarter than they actually are.  I did not want to be one of these people, and while I still fear that I am, I have come to care less.

As I've grown older and somewhat wiser, I have come to believe that the memes a person creates and passes on can be just as important and impactful as their genes.

I currently have no children, but am pregnant with many ideas on many subjects of great importance.  They have been gestating for many years, though some may still prove premature.  I deliver them unto you, good and wise Internet, with the hopes that together we can nourish them to full maturity and perhaps, with luck, some will survive to spread far into the future.
