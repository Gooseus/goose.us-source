So, I wrote an essy about what I believe is the [Purpose of Life](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life), as in, the objective reason for idea life as a chemical process in the Universe.  I believe this answering the "Purpose" question from this point of view is important, probably one of the most important questions facing humans, as a whole.

This is because we represent the epitome of this process - the cutting edge of the endeavour we call Life.

In the essay, I describe life as a process which maximizes the complexity of a system as a function of time (or the increase in total system entropy).  I thought this was a clever way of portraying it and a first step toward answering this question, but here I want to take few more of the steps, and hopefully improve on the original idea.

Starting with the idea that the complexity of a system increases with the knowledge contained within that system.

> Information contained in nature... allows us a partial reconstruction of the past... the develpment of the meanders in a river, the increased complexity of the earth's crust... are information-storing devices in the same manner that genetic systems are... Storing information means increasing the complexity of the mechanism.  
> - Ramon Margalef, Perspectives in Ecology Theory (1975)  
> <small>*I actually lifted this quote second-hand from Thinking in Systems, by Donella H. Meadows*</small>

When I say "knowledge", I mean simply "accessible, structured information about a given subject of interest".  With this (quite) general definition, I think we can consider the earliest self-replicating molecules as "knowledge" - the knowledge of how to replicate the knowledge of self-replication.

Self-replication, with variation, in a finite resource environment, gives rise to a selection process, which has also been described as a search algorithm:

> Sean Carroll, *The Big Picture* Quote

This search algorithm selects, within each generation, for the organims which represent the best knowledge of how to survive and replicate within their environment, creating a new generation.  This algorithm has been very successful at finding strategies for surviving and replicating in nearly every environment on our planet.

It found structures for regulating an environment at the cellular level and methods for regulating energy levels within those environments.  It discovered methods for consuming the waste of other organisms, or the other organisms themselves.  It discovered that groups of cells could work together, and specialize themselves for different tasks.  It discovered how to sense the external environment, and how to calculate the best reaction based on those senses.

This recursive search algorithm recursed again, as this genetic representation of the knowledge of how to replicate in the environment, now included the knowledge of how to collect knowledge of the current environment and how to calculate the best response from a set of possible behaviors.

This new knowledge-generating mechanism is still embedded in the the same environment and selection process, so the search algorithm operates on that mechanism in the same way, selecting for the best sensors, calculators and sets of possible behaviors.

These neural calculators are selected for the most efficient and accurate prediction of how their environment will change in the future based on their sensed knowledge of the present.

The search algorithm then found a way to efficiently store and retrieve knowledge of sequential, previous "presents".  With memory, more complex coordination strategies evolved, including language and another recursion of the search algorithm.

> Douglas Hofstadter, I am a Strange Loop Quote

The neural representation of the knowledge of how to best replicate in the environment, which emerged from a genetic representation of this same knowledge, now had knowledge of how to create and consider itself and its own knowledge.  The symbolic representation of the self, an internal state, and the environment is described by Doug Hofstrader as a "strange loop" and he utilizes the same MC Escher paintings and many other analogies to describe the "I" and self-knowledge.

And here we are, intelligent, self-aware.  We've filled billions of scrolls, books, and hard drives with even more knowledge.  Through humans, the search algorithm discovered a way to store representations of accessible, structured information - such that information it can be made available to future generations, so they can better know how to replicate themselves in their enviroment.

That environment has become bigger thanks to the knowledge we've gained recently... we now understand not just our place in a tribe, or village, or nation, or even planet.  We can now see our place in a Universe, one which is not cheering us on.  Even if the Universe was sentient, or a simulation run by sentient beings, more likely than not, we are merely one of many instances of their search algorithm.

If we wish to carry on our purpose, we need to recognize that the knowledge of the Universe, and how best to survive in it, is the most important thing we have.  We need to further develop it, and we need to preserve it - at all costs.

Taking a page from our predecessors, we need to coordinate and cooperate and leverage the mental abilities of as many different types of people available, almost 7.5 billion and counting.  Each of these minds has a potentially unique way of processing the Universe and creating new knowledge.  We have come so close to truly working together as a global community by building an information infrastructure with which to share knowledge.

We have even developed a method for discovering new knowledge which is very similar to the Universe's search mechanism.  The scientific method is a mechanism which creates new predictions about the future state of the Universe based on our current knowledge of the Universe, which is then tested in the real world with experiments.  False predictions are discarded, and predictions which consistently prove correct under real world observations stored in literature, and in the brains of other scientists, as the new "current knowledge".

But we're still a little ways away from working together in a sustainable way. The knowledge we have gained in the last couple hundred years has been leveraged for such advantage over our environment that we're actually defeating our purpose.  In addition, the vast amount of energy consumed and information generated by humans is not being directed toward this purpose.

The information infrastructure we've built to share, collaborate, create and test our knowledge is being used anti-scientifically. Our test for new knowledge does not consist of real world observation, but imagination and the trust of sources who either refuse to test their truths before spreading them or are actively spreading false truths for their own selfish purposes.

The systems we've built to maintain our civilization, the ultimate representation of our current knowledge of how to persist, do not acknowledge the purpose of life and are not built to preserve the most important aspect of our civilization against the possibility that systems will fail us in some way... even as it becomes more likely that they are indeed failing us.

The Foundation is a science fiction series written by Isaac Asimov.  In it, Hari Seldon develops psychohistory, which is a scientific discipline which seeks to predict the future from advanced models of systems and current/historical knowledge of the Universe.  When he got it working psychohistory predicted that their existing civilization, the Galactic Empire, was failing and that when it failed completely there would likely be 30,000 years of darkness and chaos.

Hari Seldon used psychohistory to try and avert this disaster, but there was nothing that could done to stop the fall of the Galactic Empire, it was too far gone.  Instead he found a way to reduce the 30,000 years of darkness to under a thousand, using a plan to reboot civilization from a project called The Foundation.

Our modern civilization needs a Foundation project, an institution that is self-sufficient and dedicated to preserving, creating and sharing knowledge, independent, but still connected to the existing infrastructures and systems.  The Foundation needs to be part university, part monastery, and part sustainable off-grid community.  The concept of Knowledge is sacred, but the actual knowledge content should be questioned and tested on a regular basis.

Sharing knowledge through education, creating knowledge through research and philosophy, and preserving knowledge by preparing for major changes in our social, political, economic, or ecological environment need to be the primary directives.

I have a plan to make Foundation a reality, but it's not a one person job.  Psychohistory isn't a thing, but I do believe that a case can be made for the wisdom of acting as though our civilization had a high likelihood of failure.  I believe I can also make a case for Foundation being a good idea, even if civlization is doing fine.

If you're with me so far, please let me know if you'd like to help.  If you'd like to hear me make these cases, then let's have a conversation.
