<!-- I believe that knowledge is a fundamental unit of the Universe, and I mean that somewhat literally.  Sometimes information is considered the fundamental unit and I wouldn't attempt to disagree with that, but knowledge is basically a meaningful form of information, and I'm not necessarily here to 


I'm a glutton for punishment with this post.  After already making outlandish claims regarding [the purpose of life](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life), I'm about to dive into another philosphical hotpot by making claims about "knowledge" well above my pay grade and formal education.  But considering the claims that are made nowadays, by people of great prominence and power no less, I hardly feel like my own can would make much difference if they were ridiculous... and if they aren't, well then, that would be great.

So let's begin with my favorite quote from my favorite person:
 -->


This quote has always been a favorite of mine and lately I've been considering it within the context of my first post on the [Purpose of Life](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life) where I describe life as chemical process that maximizes the complexity of its enclosing system over time (the area under the curve).  Given enough time and the right environment it's possible for a form of life to evolve which can become relatively cognizant of itself in the ordering of the Cosmos, as evidenced by us.

The primary mechanism that life uses to increasing complexity has been genetic evolution, however, since the advent of humans, complexity has been rapidly increased through a mechanism of memetic evolution in the forms of language, culture and technology, what we collectively called civilization.

I believe these mechanisms are similar enough to consider the entire endeavor a form of knowledge creation and the maximization of complexity could also be considered the maximization of knowledge, since it is knowledge which allows complexity to be increased and maintained.

The structures that are brought into being and persist by way of the mechanisms of adaptation and replication can be considered knowledge structures, whether that knowledge is a new protein which protects against a certain environmental factor or an innovation in war, agriculture or philosophy.

If the purpose of Life is to maximize complexity within it's enclosing system, then a requisite purpose is to maximize knowledge.

However, not all knowledge is created equally... some knowledge is relative, such as a strategy for surviving in a given environment, and other is absolute, such as the knowledge of the relationship between the sides and angles of a triangle.

Absolute knowledge can be considered true across time and space within our Universe and informs relative knowledge.  The hard sciences which describe the core interactions of the cosmos will be true and will inform how to do certain types of work anywhere.  This is why we are able to make robots that can conduct useful work while flying through the solar system, rolling around Mars, or while attached to comets.

Relative knowledge is only true for a subset of space and time.  Photosynthesis can be considered knowledge of how food can be created from CO2 and solar energy which has supported life for for billions of years, yet the specific strategies of photosynthesis are tuned to our particular star and atmosphere.  A different combination of atmosphere and starlight could give rise to life that utilizes a similar strategy, but the knowledge of how to store chemical energy from Sol (our star) in our atmosphere would not be useful and transferrable to a planet with a different light spectrum and intensity and different atmospheric chemical makeup.

Both types of knowledge are useful can be considered knowledge of the Cosmos, one was developed by way of trial and error over billions of years and the other was developed by a more refined form of trial and error (hypothesis and experimentation) over a few hundred years.  The mechanisms are similar and both serve the purpose of life in that they underpin the to increase of complexity.






So when did the Cosmos start to know itself?  And how does knowledge factor into the purpose of maximizing complexity under the curve?

If we can consider knowledge a physical thing, perhaps a unit of ordered information, then we can say that the Cosmos began to know itself once it began to form these structures.  This is, perhaps, not in keeping with classical epistomology, but much like my Purpose narrative, I find it more useful to begin by ignoring the centrality of humans.  I will continue to make the case that Life had a purpose before humans evolved as a part of it, and the Cosmos had knowledge before 


This is one of my favorite quotes from one of my favorite people.  But I've been thinking about it more recently, and asking more probing questions about it.

Is consciousness the only way that the Cosmos has of knowing itself?  Has the Universe been ignorant of itself for the last 14 billion years?  What would be considered the first knowledge of the Universe?

Looking for answers turned up a lot of interesting places for someone like me to get distracted with, but most treatises on historical knowledge seem to begin with the first writings, first civilizations and first philosophies.  Did humans really only begin to accumulate knowledge when they could preserve evidence for modern humans to find?

Certainly we can say that humans had a knowledge of hunting and gathering long before they had knowledge of farming, and they must have had the knowledge of how to avoid predators and scavenge before they had knowledge of hunting.  Their knowledge evolved with the capacity of their brains to store that knowledge and communicate it to other humans.  Some knowledge was certainly taught while some was encoded as instinct, what about the knowledge of how to procreate?

I'm going to take a somewhat radical stance here and say that the knowledge of the Cosmos began when rules emerged, and with each emergence of new complexity the Universe gained new knowledge.  My definition of knowledge seems to cast the Universe as the "knower", but this shouldn't be taken as my positing there to be some kind of Universal Intelligence or God.  I don't feel this is a necessary assumption since being intelligent humans we can cast themselves as the knowers and project ourselves into the role of any knower.  This is done all the time with anthropomorphizing animals and objects in fables or everyday language.  It's a convenient substitution to illustrate a point, similar to how physics allows someone to take a different frame of reference in order to more easily solve a problem.

In my [The Purpose of Life](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life) post I spent a lot of time talking about complexity and the Universe and how Life maximizes complexity.  I believe that complexity is related to the emergence of new knowledge of the Universe, which will eventually lead me to a synthesis of ideas where the Purpose of Life is to maximize the existence of the knowledge of the Cosmos.

But first, lets talk about the *Emergence of Everything* by Harold J. Morowitz in the context of the "Everything" being that Cosmic Knowledge.


## The Emergence of Knowledge

In *The Emergence of Everything* Morowitze identifies 28 emergent steps throughout the history of the Universe and if we were to personify this Universe, we could refer to them as 28 steps in realizing knowledge.

The first seven steps are physical in nature, the eighth is the emergence of biology from chemistry and the next twelve are biological with step 21 being the emergence of early hominids, step 24 is the emergence of language and *homo sapiens* with the final 4 steps being th emergence of what many would actually refer to as true knowledge - agriculture, technology, philosophy and "the spiritual".

### The Primordial to the Biosphere

The first thing the Cosmos gained knowledge of were the laws and constants of nature which expressed themselves in the early moments/years of the hot, dense Universe.  As these laws acted to cool and expand this early Universe, the Cosmos realized that these laws and constants aggregated the stuff of the Universe into large-scale structures.

As these structures further solidified the Cosmos knowledge of gravity gave rise to the knowledge of nucleosynthesis in the first stars which burned brighty and exploded to create new matter.  Additional stars formed and newer materials were formed and the Cosmos gained knowledge of the set of different elements that could make up matter.

As newer generations of stars formed they aggregated much of this new matter around them into stellar discs which themselves aggregated into smaller structures such as planets, asteriods and comets.  The Cosmos had gained knowledge of planetary solar systems.

These planets took on many forms dependent on the elements that aggregated into their makeup, but as gravity and various other forces acted on them they created nested spheres based on the phases of matter, from gaseous atmospheres, liquid hydrospheres and solid lithospheres.  Combined they created the geospheres which could potentially give rise to increasings complex chemical interactions.

With the creation of many geospheres, certain of these contained the right combination of chemical and energy resources to give rise to the chemical reactions we identify with proto-life.  With the emergence of self-replication, the Universe gained knowledge of how to persist information about how to persist in a particular environment...  in some ways this proto-life represents the first of self that the Cosmos truly gained.


### Defining Knowledge

[The definition given by Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=definition+knowledge) is:

1. facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
  * what is known in a particular field or in total; facts and information.
  * true, justified belief; certain understanding, as opposed to opinion. 
2.  awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.


The first line in [the Wikipedia article for Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge) is:

> Knowledge is a familiarity, awareness, or understanding of someone or something, such as facts, information, descriptions, or skills, which is acquired through experience or education by perceiving, discovering, or learning.

And the Oxford Dictionary definition is:

1. Facts, information, and skills acquired through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.
  1. The sum of what is known.
  2. Information held on a computer system.
  3. True, justified belief; certain understanding, as opposed to opinion.
2. Awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation.
3. *archaic* Sexual intercourse.

Knowledge seems to be dependent on awareness, perception and/or experience, which seems to imply sensory capability from a subjective observer.

What if, for the sake of philisophical discussion and poetic allegory, we removed this requirement... would approaching the idea of the Cosmos knowing itself without a sensory mechanism be senseless?

To be clear, I'm not trying to imply that the Universe is actually sentient or trying to justify belief in any God or Universal Intelligence.  This is not an attempt to smuggle in some kind of mysticism or religiousity, I'm an agnostic and I personally believe that any Universe-God intelligence would be a passive observer, undifferentiated from a lack of a God-Intelligence.

What I'm trying to do here is utilize non-living observers to frame a different story about knowledge and the Universe which I believe will be useful.

### Senseless Knowledge

Does a star know how to fuse hydrogen?  Does a planet know how to rotate around a star?  Does mass know how to gravitate and do electrons know how to flow?  Can we speak about the first knowlege as simply the universal constants and the physical laws of nature which give rise to the changes we describe using the Core Theory and our other scientific models?  Does the Universe know how to expand and increase entropy?

From a subjective point of view, we assume that knowledge of the natural world is possible and the knowledge that we can know how these things are accomplished gives us the ability to act as a proxy.  We can speak about the sun "knowing" how to fuse hydrogen because we have the knowledge of how it does.

This may seem like circular logic, but I believe this is similar to shifting the frame of reference in a physics problem.  I like to believe this is possible because of recursive knowledge, which is created by way of consciousness.

### Recursive Knowledge

Lets assume that the Universe found itself with the knowledge of how to come into existence and progress from state to state.  It discovered the universal constants and how elementary particles could combine into the subatomic particles and forces that could give rise to nebula, stars, black holes, galaxies and planets in great abundance and variety.

Despite the variety of large structures, the Universe only knew how to build a few handfuls of stable atomic particles from the few subatomic particles, yet the Universe discovered how they could react with each other in many different ways to create different build up to, and break down from, almost infinite molecular structures.  The abundace of different planets were a product of the abundant ways that the atomic elements can interact.

These myriad chemical structures the Universe knew were sometimes fleeting and momentary, at other times, stable and long lasting.  These molecules could react in different ways, but could only build up or break down into other structures, if they persisted, they did so in a static form.  However, there came into existence molecules with the ability to replicate and multiply their structures.  The Universe gained knowledge of how to persist and proliferate complex molecular structures.

I like to think about these first persistent structures as the initial physical representations of knowledge.  They represented knowledge of how the Universe can persist knowledge within a given environment.  Their flexible structure meant that they could replicate imperfectly and create new versions of replicators which might persist in different ways in different environments.  This differentiation created versions of this knowledge which "disagreed" on how best to persist knowledge in a given environment, where the environment inevitably selected the better version (or "idea") of how to persist.  The Universe could now aggregate new knowledge of how to persist its knowledge in various environments.



YOU ARE HERE

Better yet, these replicators persisted themselves imperfectly and when they replicated in a new way that could not be maintained or replicate within their environment, they broke down.  When they replicated in a new way that proved able to replicate faster or persist longer, they persisted even more strongly.  The Universe had knowledge of how to learn new ways of building knowledge.

These replicators encountered each other and one became the dominant aspect of the others environment.  The effectiveness of a replicator was directly related to how well it could persist and replicate in an environment full of replicators.  The knowledge of the replicators represented the knowledge of how their environment worked.  The Universe had knowledge of competition, which drove knowledge of the universe itself.

Replicators found other, less competitive, replicators that had knowledge of how to create molecular structures which helped against environmental dangers.  The Universe had knowledge of cooperation and specialized knowledge.

Soon replicators were building complex machines in concert with many others and developing specialized strategies, all in service of developing more specific and useful knowledge of how to persist and replicate in their environment.  Each individual replicator carried a specific strategy, similar to others of its kind and when that strategy proved more useful, they persisted this new knowledge to another generation, when it didn't their knowlege was forgotten.  These strategies involved vast networks of sensors and complex computational systems which were able to anticipate changes in their environment in vastly intelligent ways.  The Universe now had knowledge that many would actually agree can be considered knowledge.

These highly intelligent replicators evolved even larger brains with more complex computational systems and social structures which allowed for the creation of complex languages which could encode adapting knowledge of their environment.  They had knowledge of themselves and a sense of their temporary place in their environment.  The Universe gained knowledge of itself.

As the language and social structures of these intelligent replicators evolved further, they became aware of their own knowledge of themselves and their environment and developed ways complex ways of understanding the world, their place in it, and their own knowledge of it.  The Universe had thus developed knowledge of its own knowledge of itself, at this point, knowledge took on its true meaning and the knowledge of the rest of the Universe became unlocked to itself.

For the Cosmos to know itself, it must first creation recursive functions for generating and persisting knowledge.  We are the application of those functions, which can now truly know.

So what definition would pertain to a Universe that didn't include Life capable of awareness.  I don't want to get into panpsychism or talk about some notion of consciousness that pertains to the Universe because it seems like an unnecessary digression.  What I do want to try to get to is a definition of knowledge that involves capabilities and it's entirely possible that knowledge isn't the appropriate word, however, it's what I'm going to go with until I have a better one.

So take, for instance, the idea that the Universe "knows" how to create a star.  This wasn't "learned" in the classical sense, but if you take the notion that the laws of physics became fixed at a point close to the Big Bang, then it could be said that the Universe acquired the information at this moment which with which it was able to then create galaxies, stars, quasars and black holes.

Maybe a better concept would be to describe the knowledge of the Universe to be any phenomenon that can be known by an observer.  The Universe doesn't know how to reverse the arrow of time or decrease entropy in a closed system, but it does know how to increase entropy and construct various material structures at many scales from chemical processes.

If it can be called knowledge regarding the Universe, then it can said to be knowledge possesed by the Universe.  That is some circular logic, but self-evidently true considering our definitions of knowledge can only apply within a Universe that is made up of parts of the Universe, such as ourselves.

### Self-Replicating Knowledge 

So from this point of view, everything that occurs in the Universe that can be known is knowledge that Universe is acting on.  The Universe can produce stars because the laws of nature give it the knowledge to do so.  The Universe can produce complex chemical reactions and self-replicating molecules for the same reason.  A molecule has knowledge of how to react to with other molecules and can produce and produce other molecules.

Some knowledge is fleeting and exists only long enough to produce a reaction and disipates.  However, a self-replicating molecule has the knowledge of how to replicate itself and can persist.  It persists because it has knowledge of how to persist itself, knowledge of how to persist knowledge.  The Universe has knowledge of how to persist knowledge of itself over time, the first evidence of a proto-meta-cognition.

I'm going deep down a rabbit hole now, but we can't stop now, the only way out is through.  The beautiful thing about the classical version of knowledge is that bullshit doesn't last long without having some value to people and since I direct these ideas toward people who only value truth, this entire post can be considered and relegated to the dustbin in a short amount of time if it proves unable to find purchase in the mind of an audience with enough value to then replicate itself in some form of sharing.

Time is the great filter for useless or untrue knowledge... and applying this idea to my conception of knowledge, we find that it applies in the form of evolution.
