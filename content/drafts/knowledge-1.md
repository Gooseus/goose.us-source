The purpose of life is to discover knowledge of how to best replicate (and generate) knowledge of how to persist Life in the Universe.  Since more knowledge means more complexity




### Complexity and Knowledge

I speak at length regarding systems and complexity in my [Purpose of Life essay](/thoughts/the-purpose-of-life), but the main takeaway is that living systems (such as our planet or its myriad nested ecosystems) increase the complexity of a system as the entropy of the system increases.  I posit that this is the purpose of any living system (and Life in general) - to maximize the sum total of complexity within their system over the lifespan of the system.




I define complexity using information theory to be the amount of information required to fully describe (or model) the system.

Take, for instance, a planet that was made up of only one element which changed predictably over time based only on its position relative to the sun, this system could be modeled with a minimal amount of information.  We would have a fairely accurate prediction of the current state of the planet from just knowing the properties of that single element, the dimensions of the planet, and the current position relative to its sun (as well as the stellar properties of that sun).  This is because most of the properties of the planet are fairely constant (elemental propeties, planetary dimensions, stellar properties) and thus the number of possible states it could be in are very small and changes only in response to a single dynamic variable.

A planet with many different elements making various chemical structures (as is more common amongst planets) would be more complex as these added variations create the possibility for different states in the ways they react with each other.  A chemical reaction which created unpredictable feedback loops would be even more complex, as the dynamics for these feedback loops would also need to be encoded to accurately model the the planet.

If these feedback loops involved highly variable molecules which consumed resources in the process of replicating themselves they would be even more complex... and if those molecular variations conferred subtle variations in how those molecules behaved and replicated, then we could consider the system still even more complex.  You can see where I'm going here.

However, when I say that the purpose of life is to maximize complexity, I do not mean that life creates complexity as an end of itself.  Complexity is created by life because it confers a competitive advantage, or rather, complexity is created by life *when* it confers a competitive advantage... more often than not an adaptation that increases complexity may not be advantageous in survival and reproduction, and would thus be a disadvantage since complexity does not come without a cost.  The cost comes in the form of increased resources in order to build and maintain the new complexity.

If an organism develops a new behavior, then the total set of behaviors it can apply in a given situation is increased and the structures that allow this new behavorial pathway must be maintained.  The energy needed to build and maintain that structure must be provided by more food (energy); the behavoir should then either reduce the energy needed to replicate, or increase the chances of replcation, in order to offset that cost of the complexity.  If not, this organism is working harder for the same odds of replicating, which would lose as a strategy over time. 

So, the complexity that life gives rise to is the kind that allows life to have an advantage in the pursuit its goal of turning the environment into copies of itself.  These complexities must be encoded by life in an accessible form of information to allow them to be replicated into the next generation, so what we observe as an increase in the complexity of a living system is the increase in the complexity of the information being encoded.

This information is a set of instructions which allow an organism to behave in a way which maximizes the chances of that information being passed on to another generation.  Another way of describing this would be to say that the life is increasing complexity by increasing the amount of knowledge an organism has about its environment and the best way to carry out its goals within it.

### Cosmic Knowledge

> We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.  
> -- Carl Sagan, Cosmos, 1980

Carl Sagan was a master of quotations like this one, and while I don't believe he was attempting to base a a philosophy on this, I've begun to use it as a concise summation up my philosophy of Life, the Universe, and Everything <small>*(without puncuation this quote is 42 characters long, just saying...)*</small>.

Knowledge is a word with many meanings depending on context, but I'll simply define it here as "accessible, structured information pertaining to a subject of interest".  The subject of interest in Sagan's quote is "the Cosmos" and since any "We" is necessarily a part of "the Cosmos", any structured information accessible, and pertaining, to the Cosmos would be considered a "way for the Cosmos to know itself".

When Sagan says "We" he is obviously referring to "humans", but I think this phrase could be also be applied to any aspect of the Cosmos that has access to information pertaining to the Cosmos.  I would say that "We" refers to all of life, with the first being those self-replicating molecules with their initial knowledge being the structured information of how to replicate the knowledge of self-replication from the resources in their environment.

As that initial life multiplied their activity and presence altered their environment, which required a change in the knowledge necesary to continue replicating in that environment, which further altered the environment.  This created a positive feedback loop of upward complexity driven by the evolution of ecosystems.

Fast-forward to today and it's hard to even fathom the massive amount of complexity existing in a square meter of any run-of-the-mill forest.  Paul Krafel paints a picture of this in his book, [Seeing Nature](https://amzn.to/2Kmy3yw), as he describes life as a creator of surfaces:

> ...  
> I was thinking about mats of moss covering smooth, glacial bedrock as I walked through a forest.  How did this forested place look before life?  Without life, this forest would be just a bare bedrock surface.  Within the forest, I suddenly became ware of life as a creator of surfaces.  Tress tower a hundred feet into the air, branching intricately into smaller and smaller twigs with each twig sending out a multitude of broad-surfaced leaves.  Each trunk has a furrowed bark whose creases and ridges provide a wealth of nooks and crannies within which tiny insects lay eggs, spiders spin webs, and birds probe with their beaks.  
> &nbsp;  

>  Beneath the tree lie the abundant surfaces of fallen leaves decaying into soil that is filled with roots branching into a multitude of rootlets and root hairs.  Each rootlet provides a juicy surface upon which some tiny insect might suck.  Root worms between soil fragments in search of moisture soupy rich in dissolved minerals.  The root probes downward until they creep across the bedrock, searching for cracks to explore, the roots pry open cracks and split bedrock, creating still more surfaces deep beneach the ground.  
>...  
> Life creates surfaces because life needs surfaces.  Life photosynthsizes along surfaces, breathes and digests along surfaces, sits on surfaces, sleeps on surfaces, lays eggs on surfaces  
> ...  

> -- [Paul Krafel, Seeing Nature, 1999](https://amzn.to/2Kmy3yw)

All those living surfaces represent just a fraction of the structural complexity that life gives rise to, and the knowledge of how to build and use each surface is ultimately embedded as structured information, though not all life embeds all of this knowledge as nucleotides.

As ecosystems evolved to become filled with competing life, those that could perceive the environment and more finely tune their reactions according to their perceptions began to exhibit complex intelligence.




### Evolution of Knowledge

As the initial knowledge evolved to include knowledge of how to better control their environment with semi-permeable cell walls and how to store energy/release through the Calvin and Krebs cycles, the overall goal of life was still to simply replicate itself out of the resources available in the environment.  Of course, they were aspects of the environment for other variations of life, and depending on their strategy for using this shared environment they either cooperate or competed with these other variations.

Since living organisms were now a part of the environment, additional knowledge for replicating and surviving evolved, such as how to consume other organisms and using them as resources directly.  They also began to spread to other environments and diversify their existing environment, creating niches for more variations of life to evolve into.

Some great imagery can be found in Paul Krafel's amazing book where he describes life as a creator for surfaces:



If we think of each surface described here and the organisms (with their own surfaces) which utilize each surface as a niche, we can easily see how the complexity of the planetary system expands out exponentially.  Each of those organisms have their own unique DNA which encodes at least some of the way in which they create or use each surface, as well as the rest of that organisms supporting structures and behaviors.

#### Genetic Knowledge

Most living systems, including the first we would identify as such, rely primarily on nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), and the proteins they build from them, for the leveraging their niche of the Cosmos.  Each living organism on Earth knows how to survive and replicate itself in its environment.  Each species represents a class of survival/replication strategies, and each individual is an instance of their class, more the same than different, but different enough to create advantages or disadvantages.

This process of evolving genetic knowledge has been described as a search algorithm[1] for "the best local strategy of survival" (FIX) as each difference between parent and offspring is a new overall strategy for better surviving and propagation that strategy. This algorithm tends toward finding the best fit for every possible niche which is available for life to fill.

Through this evolution by natural selection, these strategies adapt over time to become more specialized for their niche, which may itself be changing though the impact of other species (or their own), geological or cosmological factors.  As niches become more complex, so do the strategies and gemones.

#### Neurological Knowledge

At some point new information systems develop in the form of strategies for sending and receiving environmental signals.  The neurological systems allowed for more complex behavoir by embedding a range of computational strategies on from these signals.  By deciding from set of possible reaction strategies from outside information using these computational cell networks, species were able to process their environment more efficiently, and in a whole new set of behavioral possibility, each still somewhat related to some kind of genetic code.

A strategy, within this strategy, is to generalize the computational system at birth, and allow new members of the species to learn from existing members (especially it's genetic family).  Information was passed on by way of memetics, as well as genetics.  If the neurological system could also learned from the environment, then individual behavioral adapatations were added to the bevaviors being passed on.

Niches arose which found this strategy of "general computation by way of increasing complex neural net" extremely valuable, and soon knowledge took form as a form of symbolic language between species of a group.  As certain niches allowed for more complex neural nets, we soon had the likes of the octopus, dolphin, simians, elephants, etc.

A branch of those simians took it a few step evolutionary steps further by finding the "even more massive and complex general computers" extremely successful, and the knowledge took the form of a formalized language which had knowledge of itself.

Each step described here involves an enormous, probably exponential, step up in complexity.  To reiterate, this knowledge can be as the information which would be needed to describe its state.  With a cognitive system, its almost impossible to imagine how many different states could possibly be held.

Here is a try - if you imagine a brain in two representations, one is a perfect model of the brain, with each specific type of neuron represented by a different mineral.  Now imagine the same thing, except instead each mineral is now an integrated circuit built to do the same computation as that type of neuron.

#### Language and Learning

Advanced symbolic language, and learning ability, increases in the software running on top of the hardware network.  Soon this symbolic language center is able to represent itself as an individual member of a group of human beings.

Our ability to represent ourselves, to ourself, allows us to identify ourselves from others and from the world.  What develops is what Doug Hofstader calls the [Strange Loop](https://amzn.to/2GkYDVX), which gives rise to our "I"-ness.

We learn how to develop complex skills as strategies from a variety of different model group members.  This is where that original "We" that Sagan was talking about enters the scene, formal knowledge as we usually describe it comes into being, and we can start talking about actual complexity through information theory.

The wealth and depth of knowledge can not be contained within an individual brain, or transferred easily to other brains.  Instead it is distributed across many different specialized sets of individual brains and embedded in systems of representation: writing, graphs, audio, video, and interactive applications.

The sharing of knowledge between minds by way of physical representations allowed ideas to use surfaces to encode the information that allowed minds to transfer language across space and time.  In addition to the many states that each human brain can occupy, including the supporting structures, the use of language then allowed humans to represent the complexity of their inner minds on the surfaces of their environment in order to allow anyone to see them.

All of these messages between humans are embedded, analog or digital.  There are now billions of minds exchanging language and learning from more of each other, at a blinding and exhausting pace.  Imagining the complexity needed to encode a planet with a communication and computational infrastructure which then allowed a billion of these self-aware minds to exchange memes with each other.

#### Science and Technology

The requirement that the symbols being shared with each other should represent claims of falsifiable propositions regarding the cosmos comes into being.  The ability for science to create knowledge of how to model and predict the Cosmos is the how we are able to connect so many people together and how we're able to exchange ideas with each other immediately.

Steven Pinker iterates over the ways in which science has saved the lives of people by way of medicine and technology to enable people to overcome a hostile environment quite nicely in his book [Enlightenment Now](https://amzn.to/2N37W12):

Science is what has allowed us to affect the living system on a global scale, and by mis-applying scientific knowledge we were able to abuse the resources of the living system and create an unsustainable sysem.  It has been used to enabled the power and prosperity that human minds enjoy today, but it is also being used to undermine it, by changing the environment too rapidly than can be sustained.

We know this because of science.  By creating knowledge in a scientific way, we can look back on the results of mis-applied technology, in order to find our errors and then learn from them.  But here we must then look at ourselves again, and further apply our shared energy and resources toward creating and sharing knowledge of how to learn good strategies.

### Knowledge as Purpose

Knowledge of how to truly model the world, and the good stategies of how to navigate particular situations, these are the things worth sharing.  Any intelligent species would learn that the best strategy for survival would be to create a community of minds directed toward preserving and furthing the best version of knowledge regarding how the world works.

In order to settle agreements on the true knowledge of situation, they would share their best mental abilities to solve the problem of how to find out if it is true.  Primarily utilizing a way of assessing the probability that it is true.  Once true knowledge was discovered, it would be shared between the minds in a way which optimized for their ability to create and disemminate knowledge, in all its forms throughout the Cosmos.

If we can share the true representations of symbols and scenes that we want each other to see, then we can all decide together which representations of good strategies will head toward a particular purpose.

I believe that purpose should be to help each other thrive and find a way to expand and preserve the knowledge of how to create and maintain the good ideas of how to both thrive, and serve this purpose.
