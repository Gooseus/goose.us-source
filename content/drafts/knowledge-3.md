> “We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.”  
> ~ Carl Sagan


I think about this quote often, and recently I've been thinking about what it means within the context of the that I outlined.  While I'm still well out of my depth on the math and systems science, I think a Cosmos that increases the knowledge of itself may be another way of describing a Universe that is increasing in complexity.

<!-- Another way of saying this, since time is a function of entropy, is that the Universe seeks to achieve and maintain the highest possible level of complexity for the highest level of entropy. -->

Complexity is the amount of information needed to describe something, said another way, it is the amount of information needed to store and transmit some other information.  A simplified definition of knowledge can be described as information which is structured (ordered) to convey some meaning about something.  In order to store and transmit structured information, some complexity is required.

However, the Universe, in its unrelenting pursuit of maximium entropy, does not like structured information.  It likes disorder and uncertainty, which is the enemy of knowledge.  Yet there is at least one process by which the Universe attempts to increase knowledge as a function of increasing energy.  This is Life, and I believe that my entire previous article on the Purpose of Life can be restated by describing the complexity of life as the "Knowledge of the Cosmos".

### Entropy as Quality Assurance

If you want to build good software (or any good product really) you need to subject your product to quality assurance (QA) testing.  This is where someone takes a finely crafted product, designed and built by an engineer, and attempts to break it.  They do their best to model real world scenarios where the product will fail to perform the functions it was designed for.  Sometimes it fails in a way where it just doesn't perform a function as expected, sometimes it fails catastrophically and can't be made to perform any function ever again.  In the first case, if it performs "well-enough", then the product is released into production.  If it is not "well-enough", or worse, is the second case of catastrophic failure, the engineer goes back work tweaking the design and/or implementation to fix the performance or failure issues.  A good product must pass all the tests.

Entropy has a similar role when it comes to products of the Universe.  In the vast infinite, random Universe of spacetime particles and forces interact in an infinite number of ways, but most structures do not last long.  They break down quickly under the influence of other forces, and even when they do last for a long time, none last forever.

Any structures that emerge and persist for a significant length of time can be considered products of the Universe which continues to pass QA testing.  This QA test can actually be framed as a test for truth to a single question:

**Can this structure persist?**

### Emergence as Engineering

Harold J. Morowitz describes in a wonderful book, [*The Emergence of Everything: How the World Became Complex*](https://amzn.to/2GiPpJu), 28 emergences that have occured since the dawn of the Universe.

Starting with the Primordium, moments after the Big Bang, and following through chemistry, protocells and the evolution of eukaryotes, multicellularity, and the major branches of animals leading to humans.  He describes the chain of emerging structures and interactions and how they gave rise to the next major emergence and shows that each emergence includes more complexity than the last.

In the first emergences of primitive and large scale structures - galaxies, stars, chemistry, planets, geospheres - structures came into being by way of the basic forces in the Universe (gravity, nuclear, and electromagnetic).  We can assume that many structures could have been observed in the early years of the Universe, but those that are not around today failed the entropy QA tests.

In the next emergences - metabolism, cells, organelles, multicellurarity, neurons - chemical processes gave rise to structures which I would call the first "knowledge" of the Cosmos and the began the Universal knowledge seeking process.  Every emergence from here can be considered the rapid prototyping engineering mechanism.

Self-replicating structures persists their structure by creating copies, as old copies are eliminated by entropic forces they are able to replace themselves from the resources of their surrounding environment.  They represent the first knowledge that passes the QA test without requiring long term structural stability, they are the knowledge of how to create new knowledge.  Because replication involves high variability this new knowledge is not identical and presents itself as an incremental step in a random direction from the previous knowledge.

Those variations which proved less able to turn their environment into copies of themselves failed the QA test and got recycled into other copies which got higher scores on the QA test.  Knowledge of how to persist is reframed as knowledge how to make the best use of the environment.

### Evolution as Knowledge Seeking

When applied to living systems, this mechanism of engineering and quality assurance is called adaptation and natural selection.  The emergence of new behaviors and organic structures through random adaptations of the genetic information has been constantly revising the knowledge of how to turn a given environment into more copies of their set of knowledge.

Two organisms competing for a niche are really just testing competing strategies for how to turn that environment into more of themselves.  They both "believe" they have the knowledge of how best to exist in that niche and usually only one strategy will win.

As soon as an organism discovers knowledge of how to survive in a new niche, they immediately move into it and will struggle to maintain their place there for as long as possible.

More organisms create more niches and knowledge was discovered to expoit those niches.  Multiple times, the environment changed drastically rendering much of the existing knowledge unuseable, but the more robust strategies survived and discovered the knowledge of how to exploit the new niches.

Eventually humans evolved and they discovered the knowledge of knowledge itself, which they exploited to discover the truest knowledge of the Cosmos and to change their environment, for better and worse.

### Consciousness as a Knowledge Feeback Loop

In Douglas Hofstader's [I am a Strange Loop](https://amzn.to/2GkYDVX), he spends many glorious pages exploring his thoughts on thinking and puts forth the idea of consciousnes as an emergent feedback loop


<!-- Knowledge is a "facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject", but if we're describing ourselves (the person) as a part of the Cosmos, then you could modify and simplify as "Information acquired by the Cosmos about the Cosmos".  For the Cosmos to acquire information about itself, it needs to be able to store that information in a meaninful (ordered) way, which would require a finite amount of complexity. -->


If entropy is always increasing in the Cosmos, as it is, then these ordered structures of knowledge would be continually breaking down.  This, however, is not necessarily a bad thing, because not all knowledge is true.

True knowledge can be defined in many ways, depending on how philosophical/theological/mystical you'd like to get.  I'm not interested in that, so I'll go with the idea of true knowledge of a system as predictive of future states of that system.

Some knowledge is specific to certain systems existing withing spacetime, such as the knowledge of the force a specific object will generate as it falls to the ground from a certain height.  This is true for all practical purposes, however, if you go to the moon, that knowledge will no longer be true since the force generated by a falling object is a function of gravitational and the air reisistance which are very different on different planets.  However, some knowledge is universally true, as in true across all of spacetime (in this Universe), such as predicting the length of a leg of a triangle given the observation of an angle and the two adjacent sides, or the circumference of a circle given the position of the center and any point on the edge.

Knowledge must be tested for truth with false knowledge being removed.  The perfect mechanism for this is entropy, as it systematically destroys knowledge structures which don't hold truth and provides the bits for use in a new structure.  Unfortunately, this is only a useful mechanism if the Universe already has knowledge of how to preserve knowledge deemed to be true.

If, in the early Universe a structure representing a scientific calculator had self-assembled from various molecules at random, it would have had all the capability to predict the legs of triangles or the circumferences of a circle, but it wouldn't have lasted long enough to perform a meaningful calculation.  The Universe needed to first develop the knowledge of how to preserve knowledge structure.

This is where the first emergences of life-like processes begin, and where I like to think that the Cosmos got the first hint of self-knowledge.  These molecules could vary their replicating strucutres in myriad ways, with variations impacting how they would react in their environments.  The faster replicators could make more copies over a given time period and the longer lasting replicators had a long time period to make more copies, the competition for available replicating resources meant that the combination of fast and robust replication strategies would dominate the system.  This knowledge of how to preserve and spread (local) cosmic knowledge was the foundation upon which all other knowledge would rest, including the knowledge of how to build a robust and useful scientific calculator.

The steps from self-replcating molecules to protocells and prokaryotes is a complicated and interesting one, but suffice to say that it involved the discovery of new knowledge of how to manipulate availabe matter and energy in the local system and included the dominance of two strategies for replicable knowledge storage and transferrance, the RNA and DNA molecules.  At this point Darwinian natural selection became the primary mechanism for life to discover new complex ways to perpetuate increasingly complex knowledge of the many niches of Earth.

The local predictive knowledge of that life exhibits is amazingly complex at even the lowest levels and amazingly robust to change as a whole, even after the many mass exinction events and changes to the environment, life still adapted its strategies and re-emerged to discover new ways to manipulate nature and find more niches to enter.

Eventually the mammals, marsupials, apes and hominids came along and developed increasingly complex, dynamic, social knowledge of each other, allowing for animal societies and culminating with the evolutions of humans who discovered complex knowledge of themselves, becoming what we call conscious.

Along with consciousness, humans generated symbolic language and the Universe now had knowledge creators with self-knowledge and a new way for them to store and transmit their knowledge through time and space.  Culture became a repository for group knowledge and then written language allowed this cultural knowledge to take on a physical and immutable form.

From this point new technological and cultural knowledge flourished and supported the creation of knew knowledge and ways of transmitting and storing this knowledge.  The mechanism for testing knowledge for truth was collective aggreement and the ability for the holders of knowledge to survive and spread their knowledge.

Natural scientists and philosophers were the first to attempt to systematize knowledge in a way which could determine the truth of claims and abstract local knowledge into universal knowledge.  They discovered the relationships between shapes and measurements and found algorithms for using symobolic languages to predict phenomenon and other measurements that couldn't be found directly.  Eratosthenes was able to estimate the circumference of the entire planet in 3rd century BC using measurements of shadows taken at the same time in Alexandria and Syene.

Today we have store our symoblic representations of knowledge in our minds, on various mediums that we've used through time and in our information systems, such as hard drives on personal computers and in the cloud.  All of this organized knowledge represents a huge explosion of complexity within our system, but we're still not free of the destructive forces of the Universe, and in some ways, we're even more fragile.

The systems we've set up which drive the creation of the knowledge and those mediums that we use to store and spread our information are designed on false assumptions regarding the negative effects complexity.  These are the technological systems and the social systems.

Resources required to maintain the existing complexity increase faster than new knowledge can increase the availability of resources.  New knowledge also requires more resources to find than the previous "low hanging fruit" that were plucked in the last few hundred years.  Additionally, complexity itself become more fragile as it grows, meaning that a small amount of entropy in the right places can destroy a system.

The other mechanisms that increase the fragilty and decrease the returns are the social systems that underlie the technological ones.  Political and cultural systems can not adapt as fast as the technology changes the foundations they're built on and the economic systems additionally have the feature of being built entirely on debt/investment.  The mechanism of compounding interest means that the economic system has a built in expectation that the resources being used will generate exponential returns, which runs counter to the fact of diminishing returns from complexity.

It is at this point that we reach a critical juncture in the goal of increasing and maintaining the knowledge we have accumulated thus far.  We must once again turn inward and apply our knowledge creation mechanisms to understanding the systems and complexity upon which these mechanisms rest.

The mechanisms and strategies that have gotten us here are not the ones that will get us to to the next peak, this is a local maxima and our ability to see the next peak ignores the valley with many steep cliff faces that exist between there and here.
