### The Author

I am Shawn Marincas, Gooseus is my online alias and pen name (pronounced "goosey-yus").  It's a Latinized version of my HS nickname (which was not a reference to [Top Gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun)) which I adapted for myself in college after watching [Gladiator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_(2000_film)) and needing an Xbox Live handle.

I'm originally from Brick, New Jersey and am now a resident of Portland, Oregon.  My only formal education is a Bachelors of Computer Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and I'm employed full-time as a web developer (or fullstack engineer, or whatever the trending title is).  I consider myself an autodidact and hope that someday I'll be able to consider myself a polymath.

While internet technology is the focus of my job, I'm far more interested in the wider subjects of philosophy, science, psychology, economics, and any others involved in understanding the myriad ways the Universe interacts with itself.

I have recently declared myself a [poetic naturalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_naturalism), following the philosophical framework formalized by [Dr. Sean Carroll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll) to describe someone who is a naturalist, but also believes that there are many ways of talking about the world, so long as they are grounded in scientific truth and are useful for talking about a particular domain.

I am an agnostic at heart, but enjoy useful stories involving metaphorical god constructs.  I believe that Knowledge is a fundamental unit of Life and self-knowledge would be the goal of a pantheistic God, this follows from my favorite quote from my favorite person.

> “We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself.”  
> ~ Carl Sagan, 1990

I'm here to expand and formalize my philosophy of life, the universe and knowledge through further open discussion of my current [thoughts](/thoughts).  To start I have waded into the philosophical waters with the aid of Carroll's poetic naturalism framework with a statement of what I believe is Life's ultimate [purpose](/thoughts/a-purpose-for-life).

As I hope to make clear over time, this philosophy of purpose will give rise to a loose ethical framework and, hopefully, a belief-based network of like-minded individuals and groups who also seek to shape the future of our world with reason and compassion.
